# Front-end Virtuoso

Welcome to my "Virtuoso Synthesizer" app !!!

This is a complex app which I'm using to sing different songs with different instruments and to record and save my own musical compositions. I created the front-end with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. For the backend I created a RESTful API with the help of PHP and the Symfony framework.
I made the connection to the MySQL database using the Doctrine library from Symfony. 
In this repository I put the detached front-end. You can see the back-end code by accessing this link: https://github.com/ionut1993255/virtuoso-back-end

Here you can see a small presentation of the project:
