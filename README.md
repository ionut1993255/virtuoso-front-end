# Front-end Virtuoso

Welcome to my "Virtuoso Synthesizer" app !!!

This is a complex app which I'm using to sing different songs with different instruments and to record and save my own musical compositions. I created the UI design with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Here you can see a small presentation of the project:

Check out the custom favicon *wink *wink

Hope you enjoy !!!
